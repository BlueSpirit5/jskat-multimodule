<h4>JSkat Hierarchy</h4>
In JSkat, a single skat game is embedded in a strict hierarchy, which kind of emulates a real life situation.<br>
<ul>
    <li>At the top is a Skat table, on which the game takes place. The table currently holds three (empty) cha√≠rs to be filled with players. You can also name your table.</li> 

    <li>On the table, a Skat series can be started. Firstly, you have to decide what type of players should be there. A player can either be an AI player, 
    a human player or a network (i.e. remote human) player. You can also give a name to each player. 
    Then, a series has a certain duration (i.e. number of rounds to be played). Finally, a series has a certain set of rules (e.g. official tournament rules, 
    pub rules or an individual ruleset).</li> 

    <li>During the series, several games of skat are played. (Although the games could be grouped into rounds, we deemed such an element in the hierarchy unnecessary.) 
    Under the rules of the series, a skat game also has a certain set of rules (e.g. ramsch games).
