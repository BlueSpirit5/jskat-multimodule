<h3>JSkat Help</h3>
<h4>Getting started</h4>
<p>
Basically, there are two ways to use JSkat:
<ul>
<li>To play offline against AI players</li>
<li>To play online, using JSkat as a GUI to the <a href="http://www.iss.org">International Skat Server</a> (ISS)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Playing offline</h4>
<p>
To play against two computer AIs, you have to create a skat table and start a skat series at that table. 
Either use the menu or the corresponding button to create a skat table. You can name your table, if you like.
(This is only necessary if you want to create more than one table at a time.)<br>
Once the table has been created, you will find a button at the center of the table to start the skat series.
In the dialog you can set names for the AI players and yourself and you can choose the type of AI player you want
to play against.
<dl>
<dt>Algorithmic</dt>
<dd>This player has a set of rules defined, which decide what card to play in various situations. Unfortunately, 
this player is far from fully developed. So it might satisfy an occasional player, who just wants to play a short game. 
To a more experienced and demanding player, the algorithmic player will seem rather crude and stupid.</dd>
<dt>Neural network</dt>
<dd>dummy (--&gt; Jan!)</dd>
<dt>Random</dt>
<dd>The most stupid kind of AI player. At least, he knows the rules and always plays a valid card. However, from the 
set of possible cards, a card is chosen at random.</dd>  
</p>
<h4>Playing online</h4>
<p>
To play online, you need to create an account at the ISS.
